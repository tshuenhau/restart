# RE:start by 15TH - Revolutionizing Recycling

## Vision
At RE:start, we envision a future where recycling seamlessly integrates into daily life, inspiring individuals and communities towards sustainable practices for a cleaner, greener planet. Our innovative approach aims to drive meaningful behavior change and make recycling accessible and rewarding for everyone.

## Problem Addressed
The world grapples with waste generation and unsustainable consumption patterns. Traditional recycling methods lack in convenience, engagement, and effectiveness, resulting in low participation and impact. Additionally, insufficient community connection and awareness further impede sustainable practice adoption. RE:start aims to tackle these challenges head-on.

## Creating Impact
RE:start's mission is to revolutionize recycling and promote sustainable consumption and production practices. Through a convenient, engaging, and rewarding mobile app, we empower individuals to contribute to a circular economy, aligning directly with SDG 12 for sustainable lifestyles, efficient resource use, and waste generation reduction.

## Uniqueness
RE:start stands out with a holistic approach combining convenience, gamification, and community engagement. Our doorstep collection services and the gamification of recycling processes transform it into an enjoyable experience, while mobilizing volunteers passionate about sustainability enhances our reach and community impact.

## Sustainable Business Model
We aim to sell collected recyclables to recycling companies and organizations, enabling us to cover operational costs and promote a circular economy.

## Future Goals and Plans
Currently in our pilot phase, we aim to expand PET bottle collection capacities and explore broader recycling services, alongside potential upcycling projects. We're also seeking collaborations to enhance our recycling ecosystem.
